# 2048
## Created by Danish Wasif, Evan Woo, Michael Xie, and Justin Ye.

This code is created for our ICS 4U project and created with Netbeans 8.2. This has a GUI interface with the game "2048" and tests the player by seeing how long it takes for them to get to 2048.
The code also has a file IO system where it stores user's high scores and sorts them.

For more information on how to play the game, please access the tutorial section of this project.
